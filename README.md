**🧠 Brain Tumor Detection System using CNN and Transfer Learning (VGG16)**

This project is a deep learning–based web application designed to detect brain tumors from MRI scans using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with transfer learning (VGG16). It provides a user-friendly interface where users can upload brain MRI images and receive instant predictions about the presence and type of tumor with 90% accuracy.

🚀 Key Features

📷 Upload MRI scan images of the brain

🤖 Uses transfer learning with VGG16 for accurate predictions

🧠 Detects and classifies tumor types: Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary tumors

✅ Displays the uploaded image and prediction result clearly

🌐 Built with Django for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend

⚙️ How It Works

The user uploads an MRI scan image through the web interface.

The system processes the image and uses the trained VGG16-based model to predict whether a tumor is present.

If a tumor is detected, the model also identifies the type of tumor.

The result is displayed to the user, showing the uploaded image and prediction details.

📌 How to Use
